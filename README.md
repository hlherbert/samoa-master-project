This is my final project for master degree in University of Louisville. My reasearch is mainly focus on trying Yahoo SAMOA, a distributed stream data mining platform. 

Yahoo SAMOA is a new framework for distributed data mining, my project is do an initial research on this framework and try its ability on function and performa.

My main work includes four parts: 1.Build the cluster and Setup SAMOA 2.Experiment 1: Test performance of SAMOA 3.Experiment 2: Implement my own data mining algorithm (Non-Parallel Naive Bayes) on SAMOA 4.Experiment 3: Implement parallel Naive Bayes algorithm on SAMOA

I composite 3 computers in our lab into a cluster, and setup SAMOA on this cluster.

The reports could be found in "White Papers" and "Lab". The presentations could be also found in "PPT".
